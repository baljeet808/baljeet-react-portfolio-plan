# baljeet-react-portfolio-plan
A structured learning journey documenting my transition from native Android development into the React ecosystem, building a dynamic portfolio website and cross-platform mobile app along the way.


# React Portfolio Transition Plan

## Overview

This repository documents my gradual transition from native Android development into the React ecosystem. 

As an Android developer with experience in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and backend integration, I am expanding my skillset into:

- React (core fundamentals)
- Next.js (web applications)
- React Native (cross-platform mobile development)

This is a structured, part-time learning journey (~10 hours per week) with a focus on building a real-world dynamic portfolio website and companion mobile app.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Rather than casually exploring React, I am approaching this transition intentionally:

- Structured weekly goals
- Practical implementation
- Documented progress
- Real-world output (portfolio + app)

This repository serves as:
- A roadmap
- A progress tracker
- A learning log
- A public accountability system

# Learning Principles

- Slow and consistent progress
- Focus on fundamentals over complexity
- Build real projects instead of tutorial-only learning
- Document insights weekly
- Avoid over-engineering

---

# Weekly Reflection Log

Each week will include:
- What I learned
- What felt confusing
- What clicked
- What I built
- What I would improve

---

# Long-Term Goal

To confidently operate in both:

- Native Android ecosystems
- React-based web and cross-platform ecosystems

And to understand architectural tradeoffs between them.

This repository will evolve as the journey progresses.
