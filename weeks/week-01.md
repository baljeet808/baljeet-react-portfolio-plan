# Week 01 – React Foundations (Core Concepts)

## Weekly Goal

Understand the core mental model of React:

- What is a component?
- What is JSX?
- What are props?
- What is useState?
- How React re-renders UI

This week is about **clarity**, not speed.

Estimated time: ~10 hours

# Study Plan Breakdown

## Session 1 (2–3 hours) – React Basics

### Topics
- What is React?
- Component-based architecture
- JSX syntax
- Functional components

### Tasks
- [ ] Install Node.js (if not installed)
- [ ] Create a simple React app (using Vite or Create React App)
- [ ] Replace default template with your own basic component
- [ ] Create a `HelloWorld` component
- [ ] Create a `ProfileCard` component

### Outcome
You should understand:
- How components are just functions
- How JSX returns UI
- How components render inside other components

---

## Session 2 (2–3 hours) – Props

### Topics
- Passing data to components
- Reusability via props
- Destructuring props

### Tasks
- [ ] Modify `ProfileCard` to accept props:
    - name
    - role
    - experience
- [ ] Render 3 different ProfileCards using different props
- [ ] Practice mapping over an array to generate components

### Outcome
You should understand:
- React data flows top-down
- Components are reusable via props

---

## Session 3 (2–3 hours) – useState

### Topics
- What is state?
- useState hook
- How re-renders happen
- Event handling

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a counter component
- [ ] Add increment and decrement buttons
- [ ] Display dynamic message based on counter value
- [ ] Console.log inside component to observe re-renders

### Outcome
You should understand:
- State triggers re-renders
- React is declarative
- UI reflects state automatically

---

## Session 4 (1–2 hours) – Lists & Conditional Rendering

### Topics
- Rendering lists with `map()`
- Adding `key` prop
- Conditional rendering with ternary operators

### Tasks
- [ ] Create an array of skills
- [ ] Render them as a list
- [ ] Add conditional message if list is empty
- [ ] Add button to toggle list visibility

### Outcome
You should understand:
- Dynamic UI rendering
- Conditional UI updates
- Importance of keys

# Deliverables for Week 01

By end of week, you should have:

- A small React practice project
- At least:
  - 3 reusable components
  - 1 stateful component
  - 1 list-rendering example
- Basic comfort reading JSX

## Android vs React Observations

Example prompts:
- How is useState different from remember { mutableStateOf() }?
- How does re-rendering compare to Compose recomposition?
- What feels more intuitive?

- [ ] I understand props
- [ ] I understand useState
- [ ] I can render lists
- [ ] I feel ready to move to Week 02

This week is about building mental foundations, not perfection.
